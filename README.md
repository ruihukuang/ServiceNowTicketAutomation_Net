# ServiceNowTicketAutomation_Net

Project explanation

This project is to automate the process of providing insights for servicenow incident ticket management. The insights could show 3 aspects:
1 Whether tickets are assigned to one of the responsible team initially and the responsible team fixed the issues
2 What are persistent problems and root cause in platforms 
3 Duplicate tickets

Fake data are created for this project but they are based on actual cases in industry. 

Design

.Net API could connect to the react frontend and connect to a Ollma container to send requests and get responses.
