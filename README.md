# ServiceNowTicketAutomation_Net

Project explanation

This project is to automate the process of providing insights for ServiceNow incident tickets. The insights could show 3 aspects below:  
1 Whether tickets are assigned to one of the responsible team initially and the responsible team fixed the issues.    
2 What are persistent problems and root cause in which platforms in a certain period. 
3 Duplicate tickets  

Fake data are created for this project but they are based on actual cases in industry.
